branches and tags are similar but there are specific differences between them

work is always tied to a branch

git tag <tagname>
git tag (list tags
git describe --tags (show tags)
git show <tagname>
git tag -a v1 -m "Version 1.0 Release"


tags are usually used within branches. they are immutable references to particular build states in time.
