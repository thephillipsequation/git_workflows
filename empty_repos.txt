all repos intiially created are empty

.git folder is the database of all commits and objects for git

to remove git from the folder just rm -rf .git

git status just tells us what is going on currently with the git repository

git tags give us a reference to each commit that has occured

for this example repo exists in the gittest directory and if a file is changed and then committed two versions of the file will be stored. 

Only one actual file but will have 2 deltas so files can be pushed to where they are.

Takeaways Local Initialization: 
  - create empty repo
  - initialize repo
  - add files to repo
  - commit repo
