3 ways to make a copy of a git repo:
   only 2 in this video
   1 in next video
   
  for a local repo use file system and pathing i.e: cp
  disadvantage here is that it is not linked to the original repo
  if it's not linked to the original repo any changes are not pushed to the original repo

correct way to have full copy of the repo that is linked is via git
use git clone <repo1> <destdir>

to synch repos use git pull <repo>
